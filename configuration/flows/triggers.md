:::tip Before You Begin

Please be sure to read the documentation on [Flows](/configuration/flows).

## Event Hook

![Event Hooks](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/configuration/flows/triggers/triggers-20220603A/event-hook-20220602A.webp)

Event Hooks are triggered by platform or data events. The logic is based on [Custom API Hooks](/extensions/hooks). If
your event generates data, this will be stored in the Flow Object.

- **Type** — Choose the type of Event Hook:
  - **Filter (Blocking)** — Fires "blocking" right before the database transaction is committed, allowing you to tweak
    the payload or prevent completion outright.
  - **Action (Non-Blocking)** — Does not block anything. Therefore, a non-blocking action is mostly useful for
    completing tasks in response to an event, without slowing down the API.
- **Scope** — Set the specific events that trip this Trigger.
- **Collections** — Set the Collections that trip this Trigger.
- **Response Body** — Send Data for the last Operation, all Flow Object data, or the Flow key.

## Webhook

![Webhook](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/configuration/flows/triggers/triggers-20220603A/webhook-20220602A.webp)

Triggers on an incoming HTTP request to: `/flows/trigger/:this-webhook-trigger-id`.

- **Method** — Choose to make a GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE or other request from the dropdown.
- **Asynchronous** — Toggle whether or not the Trigger responds asynchronously.
- **Response Body** — Choose to send Data of last Operation, all Flow Object data, or some other key from the Flow
  object.

## Schedule

![Schedule a Cron Job](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/configuration/flows/triggers/triggers-20220603A/cron-20220602A.webp)

This Trigger enables you to create Data at scheduled intervals, via 6-point cron job syntax.

- **Interval** — Set the cron job interval to schedule when the Flow triggers.

## Another Flow

![Another Flow](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/configuration/flows/triggers/triggers-20220603A/another-flow-20220602A.webp)

This Trigger executes a Flow via the [Trigger Flow](/configuration/flows/operations#another-flow) Operation, allowing
you to chain Flows together.

- **Response Body** — Select data to return in the response to the Trigger Flow.

## Manual

![Manual](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/configuration/flows/triggers/triggers-20220603A/manual-20220602A.webp)

This Trigger starts your Flow on a manual click of a button within the Directus App. When you use this Trigger, a
**Flows** menu containing a button will appear in the Sidebar of the specified Collection Page(s) and/or Item Pages,
based on your **Location** configuration.

- **Collections** — Choose the Collection(s) to add the Button to.
- **Location** — Choose to add the button into the Item Page, Collection Page, or both.
- **Asynchronous** — Toggle whether or not the Flow executes asynchronously.
